        This is a simple frontend / html framework for building mobile friendly very simple pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Idea is to simply structure the content on the file system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Also there is some routing like for 'webaddress.com/someRoute.<br/>
            (Only works when delivered by  a server / not from file system due to CORS)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                An easy image caroussel.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Tracking of the visitors. (Available as Java Server Feature)
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <span class="alert">Be cautious!</span><br/>
        Regular tags used in the body part must always be opening and closing though their content is empty!

        <div class="code">
            &lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;
        </div>

        instead of

        <div class="code bgLightRed">
            &lt;/tag&gt;
        </div>

    </p>
    <p>
        This is due to javascript handling and parsing the DOM.<br/>
        Not following that hint may result in confusing element order when sub parts are dynamically loaded.<br/>
        I did not find a solution for that yet.
