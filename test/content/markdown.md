## Markdown

You can write your __includes__ as markdown.

The js library <a href="https://showdownjs.com" target=_blank>Showdown</a> is used to transform the code into html.  

By using the filename-ending <code>.md</code> the file is treated accordingly.  

Nevertheless, it may include html anyways as defined by markdown.
